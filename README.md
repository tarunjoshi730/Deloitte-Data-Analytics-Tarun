# Deloitte-Data-Analytics-Forage-Virtual-Internship
This repository contains my submissions for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. As part of this program, participants assist Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in heavy machinery manufacturing, in tackling various operational challenges.  This repository documents my completion of three courses in the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage.
## Deloitte - Data Analytics

### Task 1: Data Analysis
Daikibo's tech team compiled **one monthâ€™s telemetry data** (May 2021) from four factories:
- **Daikibo Factory Meiyo** (Tokyo, Japan)
- **Daikibo Factory Seiko** (Osaka, Japan)
- **Daikibo Berlin** (Berlin, Germany)
- **Daikibo Shenzhen** (Shenzhen, China)

Each site operates **nine types of machines**, reporting status updates every 10 minutes. The goal is to analyze:
1. **Which location experienced the most machine failures?**
2. **Which machines had the highest failure rate at that location?**

**Key Learnings:**
- Utilizing **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards
- Extracting insights from large datasets

### Task 2: Forensic Technology
Due to **internal concerns over gender pay inequality**, Daikibo wants to quantify the fairness of compensation across various job roles and locations. The **Forensic Technology team** has developed an algorithm to measure gender pay equality.

**Key Learnings:**
- Applying **Excel functions** for data analysis and pattern recognition
